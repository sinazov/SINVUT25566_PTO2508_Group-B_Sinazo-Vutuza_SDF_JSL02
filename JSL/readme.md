**Task Entry System**
Project Description

The Task Input and Status Validation System is a JavaScript-based application that allows users to input, validate, and track tasks efficiently. Users can enter task titles, descriptions, and statuses, with automatic input validation to ensure consistent data formatting. Completed tasks are displayed in the console, and if no tasks are completed, a motivational message encourages productivity. This project emphasizes clear logic, user-friendly interaction, and maintainable code structure.

**Technologies Used**

HTML5 – for structuring the web page

JavaScript – for interactive prompts, validation, and console logging

Browser Console – to display completed tasks and messages

Features
Created

Prompt users to enter title, description, and status for two separate tasks.

Automatically convert status input to lowercase to maintain formatting consistency.

Validate status to allow only "todo", "doing", or "done".

Alert users of invalid status and repeatedly prompt until a valid input is entered.

Store both tasks’ titles, descriptions, and statuses in separate variables.

Display completed tasks in the console with title and status.

Show a motivational message if no tasks are marked as "done".

**Usage Instructions**

Open the project in a browser.

The system will prompt you for Task 1 details:

Title

Description

Status (todo, doing, or done)

The system will then prompt for Task 2 details similarly.

Input for status is case-insensitive. Invalid statuses will trigger an alert and re-prompt.

After entering both tasks:

If a task is marked as "done", its title and status will appear in the browser console.

If no tasks are completed, a motivational message is displayed:

No tasks completed, let's get to work!
