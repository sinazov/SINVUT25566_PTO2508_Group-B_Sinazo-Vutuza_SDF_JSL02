**Kanban Board Project**

##Project Description

This Kanban Board is a responsive web application designed to help users visually organize tasks across different stages of progress: TODO, DOING, and DONE. The interface adapts seamlessly between laptop and mobile views, providing an intuitive user experience with clear visual cues and an accessible layout. The project demonstrates clean HTML and CSS practices, focusing on usability, responsiveness, and clean design.

Responsive design: Sidebar visible on laptop, hidden on mobile to optimize space

Mobile-first header update: Displays a favicon next to the project title ("Launch Career") only on mobile devices

**Task boards with columns: TODO, DOING, DONE with task cards, including icons and emoji annotations.While certain emojis were not matched accordingly to the brief,I used my own discretion and emojipedia was used.**

Consistent and clean UI: Rounded cards, clear typography, color-coded progress dots
